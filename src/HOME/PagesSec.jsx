                <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the <br/> way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best <br/> coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate the specific lots we want <br/> to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the <br/> challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with <br/> exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers <br/> through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support  <br/> farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only <br/> the finest blends, we roast each lot to <br/> highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>
